Step 1: Importing Required Libraries
First, we need to import the necessary libraries. This step is the same as before, but we'll wrap the rest of the code into functions.
Step 2: Loading and Exploring the Data
We will create a function to load and explore the data.
Step 3: Visualizing the Data
We will create a function to visualize the data.
Step 4: Preprocessing the Data
We'll create a function to preprocess the data, including splitting into train/test sets and scaling.
Step 5: Training the Model
We will create a function to train the model.
Step 6: Evaluating the Model
We will create a function to evaluate the model.
Step 7: Main Function to Tie Everything Together
Finally, we'll create a main function to call all the above functions in sequence.
